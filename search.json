The data are from the BNC 2014 spoken corpus and contain utterances that feature the phrase ‘in here’. These utterances were classified into several clusters based on several features of the attested utterances: word forms, word classes, and several semantic and pragmatic features. The assumption is that these clusters represent different types of uses of the phrase ‘in here’ and that they show differences with regard to linguistic regularities underlying the use of ‘in here’. Your job is to summarise the regularities of each cluster, and to summarise how these clusters cover the space of usages of the phrase ‘in here’.\n\n\n\nmodel='gpt-4'\n# model='gpt-3.5-turbo'\n\n\nai = AIChat( \n    console=False,\n    save_messages=False,  # with schema I/O, messages are never saved\n    model=model,\n    params={\"temperature\": 0.0},\n    system=prompt_system\n)\n\n\nn = 5\n\n\n# get distinct values of the cluster column\nclusters = df['cluster'].unique()\n# sort them\nclusters.sort()\n\n\nsource\n\nget_examples\n\n get_examples (df, cluster, n)\n\n\nexamples = get_examples(df, 0, n)\nexamples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntext\n\n\n\n\n71\nin here it wo n't allow me to store anything i...\n\n\n104\n? yeah just get a pair just to eh keep in here...\n\n\n38\ns like four or five drawers yeah there 's four...\n\n\n181\n--ANONnameM not have one ?

The phrase is often used in the context of searching for something or discussing the placement of objects.\nCluster 1: This cluster represents uses of ‘in here’ in the context of moving or coming into a place. The phrase is often used to describe someone’s arrival or relocation to a new place, such as moving into a new house or entering a room.\nCluster 2: This cluster represents uses of ‘in here’ where the phrase is used to describe the conditions or atmosphere of a place, such as its temperature or noise level. The phrase is often used in the context of commenting on these conditions.\nCluster 3: This cluster represents uses of ‘in here’ where the phrase is used in questions or exclamations about what is inside a particular place or container. The phrase is often used in the context of discovering or identifying what is inside.\nCluster 4: This cluster represents uses of ‘in here’ where the phrase is used to refer to a specific location where activities are taking place or are planned to take place. The phrase is often used in the context of discussing these activities.\nThese clusters cover a range of usages of ‘in here’, from referring to a specific location or container, to describing the conditions of a place, to discussing activities taking place in a location. They show that ‘in here’ can be used in a variety of contexts and with different meanings depending on the situation.\n\n\n\n# with open(f'../out/gpt_cluster_analysis_{model}_{n}.txt', 'w') as f:\n#   f.write(gpt_analysis)"

The data are from the BNC 2014 spoken corpus and contain utterances that feature the phrase ‘in here’. These utterances were classified into several clusters based on several features of the attested utterances: word forms, word classes, and several semantic and pragmatic features. The assumption is that these clusters represent different types of uses of the phrase ‘in here’ and that they show differences with regard to linguistic regularities underlying the use of ‘in here’. Your job is to summarise the regularities of each cluster, and to summarise how these clusters cover the space of usages of the phrase ‘in here’.\n\n\n\n\nanalysis\n\n\nCluster 0: This cluster seems to represent uses of ‘in here’ where the phrase refers to a specific location or container where items can be stored or found. The phrase is often used in the context of searching for something or discussing the placement of objects.\nCluster 1: This cluster represents uses of ‘in here’ in the context of moving or coming into a place. The phrase is often used to describe someone’s arrival or relocation to a new place, such as moving into a new house or entering a room.\nCluster 2: This cluster represents uses of ‘in here’ where the phrase is used to describe the conditions or atmosphere of a place, such as its temperature or noise level. The phrase is often used in the context of commenting on these conditions.\nCluster 3: This cluster represents uses of ‘in here’ where the phrase is used in questions or exclamations about what is inside a particular place or container. The phrase is often used in the context of discovering or identifying what is inside.\nCluster 4: This cluster represents uses of ‘in here’ where the phrase is used to refer to a specific location where activities are taking place or are planned to take place. The phrase is often used in the context of discussing these activities.\nThese clusters cover a range of usages of ‘in here’, from referring to a specific location or container, to describing the conditions of a place, to discussing activities taking place in a location. They show that ‘in here’ can be used in a variety of contexts and with different meanings depending on the situation."
