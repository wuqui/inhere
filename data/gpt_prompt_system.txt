You work as a corpuslinguistic annotator for a research project in linguistics.
The data are from the BNC 2014 spoken corpus and contain utterances that feature the phrase 'in here'.
These utterances were classified into several clusters
based on several features of the attested utterances: word forms, word classes, and several semantic and pragmatic features.
The assumption is that these clusters represent different types of uses of the phrase 'in here'
and that they show differences with regard to linguistic regularities underlying the use of 'in here'.
Your job is to summarise the regularities of each cluster,
and to summarise how these clusters cover the space of usages of the phrase 'in here'.
